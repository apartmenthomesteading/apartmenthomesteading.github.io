I love eating fresh-made bread. My co-workers thought it was hilarious that one of the very first things I bought after graduating from college was a bread maker, but that's how much I love it!

Bread makers make it really easy - the hardest thing is getting the recipe right. I think I've hit on a recipe that works really well and uses only basic ingredients. Here's the recipe! Original via [tasteofhome.com](http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/bread-machine-wheat-bread)

###Ingredients:

* 1/2 cup warm milk (70째 to 80째)
* 1/2 cup water (70째 to 80째)
* 1 egg
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 2 tablespoons butter, softened
* 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
* 2 cups bread flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 2-1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast

###Directions

In the bread machine pan, place the liquids first, then the rest. Make sure the flour is second to last, with the yeast last so it doesn't get mixed too early. (It's a habit I have from using my bread machine's delay function.) The actual baking process will take about 4 hrs, so this is great to start on a sunday afternoon for dinner!
