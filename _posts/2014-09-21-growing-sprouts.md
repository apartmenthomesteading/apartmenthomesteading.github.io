I haven't yet tried growing sprouts, but here's all you need to start cheaply growing your own, based on recommendations from an awesome book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LJBN0YW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00LJBN0YW&linkCode=as2&tag=apartmehomest-20&linkId=WKVOZRJB2PD6NVBR">Indoor Kitchen Gardening</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=apartmehomest-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LJBN0YW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It's definitely worth checking out from your local library or buying.

All you need is a glass jar and some cheesecloth or a thin dishtowel to get started. For seeds, try soy beans, mustard, radish, broccoli, mung beans, or alfalfa. Sprouting takes so little investment, feel free to branch out and experiment with plants such as fenugreek, edamame, kale, sunflower, buckwheat, and onions! 

One downside is that sprouting does take more effort - the sprouts must be rinsed and the water changed every morning and evening. If that still sounds doable, here's how to get started:

1. Put about a tablespoon of seeds in your jar and cover with several inches of warm water. 
2. Let the seeds soak overnight
3. In the morning, drain all of the water using the cloth as a filter
4. Fill the jar with a few more inches of fresh water and drain immediately
5. Put fresh water back in and repeat in 12 hours (next morning/evening) until ready to eat.

When the sprouts are ready to eat, make sure that there's no bacterial odor surrounding them. Because of all of the moisture, it's easy for bacteria to form if the water is not changed often enough or the jar wasn't clean to start.

That's it!
