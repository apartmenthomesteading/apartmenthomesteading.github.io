Whole Foods is my closest grocery store, to my horror. I was there buying some basil for a recipe and upon bringing the basil home, realized that it wasn't just a bunch of cut stalks - it was a live plant! The plant(s) had been grown hydroponically, and were rooted in a kind of spongy dirt substitute. The instructions on the bag said to place the plant in water so I did. But, before doing that, I separated out one of the several plants that were all in the same bunch, and put it in a wine bottle!

When I started, it was a lot smaller than it is here. It's grown a ton, but I'm curious as to how long it can still thrive without any soil and without any additional nutrients.
