If I have a tiny house, the next question is where to park it. There's a lot to consider - what city I should live in, the size of the land, whether building is allowed on the property, whether there's a road or electricity nearby, and whether I can legally have chickens.

But let's start with the city.

I live in Washington, D.C, but I don't think it's going to be my forever home. Homesteading and tiny houses aren't exactly the aspirations of the typlical DC professional. (That isn't to say that there aren't tiny house aficionados out there! I viewed the Boneyard Tiny House Community a couple of weeks back and the place was PACKED!)

Still, I'd love to live in a place where people are focused on what really matters - not the latest political gaffe - and are interested in being self-sufficient. (In my current apartment complex, cars start to line up outside around dinner time to deliver all the take-out. Homecooked dinners are pretty rare.)

So, if not DC, then where? Do I want to live in the middle of the city in a small lot, or do I want to have my 3+ acres? 

I was considering a middle option - in the middle of town, but a town that's in the middle of nowhere. I found a plot of land in Northern California for $7,500, with a 20 minute walk from the beach. It's absolutely beautiful. I'd post it here but I'm too afraid of people snatching it up :D.

It'd be at least a 2 hour drive from the nearest airport though, and very few people live there. Would I be able to make friends, and find work?

Anyone take a similar leap of faith? How'd it turn out?
