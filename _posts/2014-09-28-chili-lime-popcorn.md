This is a really easy recipe that tastes so much better than anything you can buy in the store. Plus, it's super cheap! (I wish I could tell you how cheap, but I'm afraid my receipt got turned into a cat toy :/)

Anyways, you can buy popcorn kernels in the bulk section of your grocery store. 

Here's all you need to make a full large bowl of popcorn.

### Ingredients ###

* <p>1/2 cup unpopped popcorn</p>

* 1 teaspoon vegetable oil

* 1/2 teaspoon salt

* 1/2 lime

* chili powder

### Directions ###

In a cup or small bowl, mix together the unpopped popcorn and oil. Pour the coated corn into a brown paper lunch sack, and fold the top of the bag over twice to seal in the ingredients.

Cook in the microwave at full power for 3 minutes, or until you hear pauses of about 2 seconds between pops. You may want to intentionally set a longer time like 4 minutes so that you don't have to start the microwave again if you need to go a tiny bit longer. Carefully open the bag to avoid steam, and pour into a serving bowl. 

Squeeze two quarters of a lime over the popcorn and stir. Sprinkle the salt and chili powder to taste.

More ideas can be found in [Leanne Brown's free cookbook](http://www.leannebrown.com/). Try adding some siracha, or try something different entirely: brown sugar and orange zest, scallions and cilantro, tumeric and coriander, parmesan and black pepper, cayenne and smoked paprika, or parm and oregano.
