Winters in Washington, D.C. can get pretty cold and dreary - at least to this California gal. Everything's bare, if there's snow it's slushy, and any of your plants outside are pretty much dead. 

Thankfully, my south-facing apartment gets a good amount of sunlight in the winter, so I've decided to try growing microgreens inside!

Microgreens are plants that are harvested very soon after sprouting - when they have their first baby leaves, called cotyledons, and sometimes their first true leaves. There's nothing special about the seeds or the plants - it's only the stage of development that makes the difference. 

Microgreens are super nutritious, too. According to the USDA, microgreens contain up to 5 times more nutrients than their mature counterparts.

I chose my plant seeds based on recommendations from an awesome book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LJBN0YW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00LJBN0YW&linkCode=as2&tag=apartmehomest-20&linkId=WKVOZRJB2PD6NVBR">Indoor Kitchen Gardening</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=apartmehomest-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LJBN0YW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
. 

Here's what I ended up getting:

<ul class="th-grid">

  </li>
</ul>

I also got Cat Grass and Lavender just for fun. By far the best value was the beets and italian basil. I have no idea how the economics of selling 25,000 seeds for $3 works, but I'll take it! Total I paid $43.70 including shipping.

I also needed a long table to put them on ([Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-6-Centerfold-Table-Multiple-Colors/33148258?action=product_interest&action_type=title&placement_id=irs-srp-1&strategy=PWVAV&visitor_id=90244001503&client_guid=57c8bffb-6a11-423c-84bf-0cb22f65f6fd&customer_id_enc=53068834812484f2ac3dfe50f0ce9b6d&config_id=8&parent_item_id=33148261%2C36706896%2C21382695&guid=d219f270-228a-4e1b-8995-10e9493ac68e&bucket_id=irsbucketdefault&findingMethod=p13n)), and some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7MTUI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000E7MTUI&linkCode=as2&tag=apartmehomest-20&linkId=T5D4LHHULHYL6I5Y">seed trays</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=apartmehomest-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000E7MTUI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and seed starter soil (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GTDIDBU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00GTDIDBU&linkCode=as2&tag=apartmehomest-20&linkId=ENUVFISJ5NXGWASY">Miracle-Gro Seed Starting Potting Mix, 8-Quart</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=apartmehomest-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00GTDIDBU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />), which I got from Amazon.  (The book recommended using seed trays that had holes in the bottom so that the microgreens could be bottom watered if needed, but I didn't want to have to buy trays for my trays.) All together, my setup cost me about $100, and that's including a reusable table. 

### Reduced Cost Version ###

If you can transport heavy objects and have a bit of spare time, you may be able to reduce costs further by replacing the seed trays with pyrex pans from thrift stores and craigslist. Similarly, you can likely find a discarded bookshelf or desk on craigslist to place your plants on. Lastly, narrow your seed choices - go for the Detroit Dark Red Beets and Italian Basil to get a huge amount of seeds for a very low price!
