Winters in Washington, D.C. can get pretty cold and dreary - at least to this California gal. Everything's bare, if there's snow it's slushy, and any of your plants outside are pretty much dead. 

Thankfully, my south-facing apartment gets a good amount of sunlight in the winter, so I've decided to try growing microgreens inside!

Microgreens are plants that are harvested very soon after sprouting - when they have their first leaves, called cotyledons. There's nothing special about the seeds or the plants - it's only the stage of development that makes the difference. 

Microgreens are super nutritious, too. According to the USDA, microgreens contain up to 5 times more nutrients than their mature counterparts.

I chose my plant seeds based on recommendations from an awesome book: [Indoor Kitchen Gardening](http://www.amazon.com/Indoor-Kitchen-Gardening-Year-round-Microgreens/dp/159186593X). They recommend:

* Arugala
* 'Red Giant' mustard
* Beets
* Cress
* Komatsuna 
* 'Ruby Red' chard
* 'Red Russian' kale
* 'Dark Opal' basil

I [bought about 100-500 or so of each to get started](http://parkseed.com/), which came to around $30 total. I also needed a long table to put them on ([Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-6-Centerfold-Table-Multiple-Colors/33148258?action=product_interest&action_type=title&placement_id=irs-srp-1&strategy=PWVAV&visitor_id=90244001503&client_guid=57c8bffb-6a11-423c-84bf-0cb22f65f6fd&customer_id_enc=53068834812484f2ac3dfe50f0ce9b6d&config_id=8&parent_item_id=33148261%2C36706896%2C21382695&guid=d219f270-228a-4e1b-8995-10e9493ac68e&bucket_id=irsbucketdefault&findingMethod=p13n)), and some [seed trays](http://www.amazon.com/Durable-Black-Plastic-Growing-Without/dp/B000E7MTUI/ref=pd_bxgy_lg_text_y), which I got from Amazon.  All together, my setup cost me about $100, and that's including a reusable table. 

Right now I'm waiting for them to arrive, but we'll see how it goes!
