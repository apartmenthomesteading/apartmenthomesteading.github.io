### Identifying Soil Texture by Measurement ###


1. Spread soil on a newspaper to dry.  Remove all rocks, trash, roots, etc.  Crush lumps and clods.
2. Finely pulverize the soil.
3. Fill a tall, slender jar (like a quart canning jar) 1/4 full of soil.
4. Add water until the just is 3/4 full
5. Add a teaspoon of non-foaming dishwasher detergent.
6. Put on a tight fitting lid and shake hard for 10 to 15 minutes.  This shaking breaks apart the soil aggregates and separates the soil into individual mineral particles.

7. Soil particles will settle out according to size.  After 1 minute, mark on the jar the depth of the sand.
8. After 2 hours, mark on the jar the depth of the silt.
9. When the water clears mark on the jar the clay level.  This typically takes 1 to 3 days, but some soils may take weeks.
10. Measure the thickness of the sand, silt, and clay layers.
11. Calculate the percentage of sand, silt, and clay.
	
	> [clay thickness] / total thickness]  =  ___ percent clay
    
	> [silt thickness] / total thickness]  =  ___ percent clay

	> [sand thickness] / [total thickness]  =  ___ percent sand

12.  Turn to the soil texture triangle and look up the soil texture class.
