I'm a 24 year-old living in one of the most expensive cities in the country. My dream is to buy a tiny house and become completely self-sufficient, but it's a catch-22: High rent and no land means it's hard to save money and learn the skills I'll need to survive. 

As I research and experiment, I'll blog about it. You'll get to see me learn how to grow microgreens, compost using earthworms, bake my own bread and more!
